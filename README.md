Here's a little project I made in 2-3 hours for fun.

If you'd like to set this up for yourself, it's pretty self-explanatory; create a Discord webhook and copy the URL, paste it as the value for an environment variable titled `WEBHOOK_URL`. Customize the frontend, do whatever you'd like, it's very simple.

If you like this project or want to see more of what I make, feel free to star the repo ⭐ or drop a follow 🙋‍♂️, it's much appreciated :)
